### Do fixed/random effects account for unmeasured confounding?

A common saying in econometrics is that fixed/random effects in analyzing panel data absorb unmeasured confounding. In other words, with repeated measurements of the same unit, a model with unit-specific fixed/random effect can bypass unmeasured confounding. Some discussion can be found in Angrist and Pischke (2009, Mostly Harmless Econometrics, Chapter 5). A recent bold example is Dee et al. (2023, Nature Communications). But this claim is a mystery, why and in what sense? Hazlett and Wainstein (2020, Political Analysis) has some useful discussion, but it also does not clarify the mystery to me.
